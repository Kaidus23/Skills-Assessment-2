APOE Gene Research Analysis

Overview:
The project aims to analyze research activity around the APOE gene, identify key researchers, and visualize collaboration networks. The analysis helps in understanding the evolving research trends and building connections in the gene therapy field.

Dataset
The analysis is based on three key CSV files:
1. articles.csv – Contains research papers with metadata (title, abstract, journal, publication year, etc.).
2. authors.csv – Provides author details and affiliations for each paper.
3. papercount.csv – Tracks the number of papers associated with each researcher.
4. countries.zip - additional zip file added for a shapefile dataset containing geographical boundaries for countries.

Objectives
- Identify key active researchers in APOE gene therapy
- Impact factor of Journals 
- Analyse publication trends and focus areas in APOE research
- Trends and Themes in APOE Research: Keywords, Evolution, and Comparative Analysis
- Map collaboration networks between researchers.
- Highlight insights to guide strategic connections.
